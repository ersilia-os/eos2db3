Title: Chemical space 2D projections against ChemDiv
Description: This tool performs PCA, UMAP and tSNE projections taking a 100k ChemDiv
  diversity set as a chemical space of reference. The Ersilia Compound Embeddings
  are used as descriptors. Four PCA components and two UMAP and tSNE components are
  returned.
