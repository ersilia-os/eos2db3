Title: Chemical space 2D projections against ChemDiv
Description: This tool performs PCA, UMAP and tSNE projections taking a 100k ChemDiv
  diversity set as a chemical space of reference. The Ersilia Compound Embeddings
  as used as descriptors. Four PCA components and two UMAP and tSNE components are
  returned.
Mode: In-house
Task: Representation
Input: Compound
Input Shape: Single
Output: Descriptor
Output Type: Float
Output Shape: List
Interpretation: Coordinates of 2D projections, namely PCA, UMAP and tSNE.
